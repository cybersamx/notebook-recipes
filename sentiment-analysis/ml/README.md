# Training a Model for Sentiment Analysis

This directory contains notebooks that demonstrate the use of classifiers in scikit learn (machine learning) for NLP and sentiment analysis.

Classifiers aren't ideal models for text-based sentiment analysis as the sentiment score of a text isn't just dependent not just on the classifications of the mere sentiment of a group of words, but also other lexical structure and relationships.

Nonetheless, it's still a fun academic exercise for playing around with scikit learn classifiers other than the usual wine, iris, and breast cancer sample datasets.

## Datasets

The notebooks in this directory use a (labeled with values) dataset of tweets from Twitter for training, but a dataset of product reviews from Amazon for prediction.

They were selected out of convenience for a fun exercise. I won't probably not use these datasets for a production project.
